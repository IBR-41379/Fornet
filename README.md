# Fornet
This Jupyter notebook contains a Python script for image segmentation using a trained model. The script predicts masks for a set of images and visualizes the original images alongside their corresponding predicted masks.

## Requirements

To run this script, you will need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- A machine learning library (the specific library is not specified in the provided code)

## Usage

To use this script, simply replace `model` with your trained model and `fm_dt` with your dataset. Then, run the script to visualize the original images and their corresponding predicted masks.
